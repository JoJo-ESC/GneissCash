GneissCash
A personal finance tracker built for people who want simplicity over feature bloat. Track your spending, set savings goals, and actually enjoy looking at your finances with a sleek dark UI and neon-colored visualizations.

Why I Built This
Most budgeting apps are either too expensive or packed with features I'll never use. I wanted something:

Free — No subscription fees
Simple — Track spending, set a goal, see my progress
Good-looking — Not the best desighner so do let me know if somthing can be improved
